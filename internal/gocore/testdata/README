This directory contains a simple core file for use in testing.

It was generated by running the following program with go1.9.0.

package main

func main() {
	_ = *(*int)(nil)
}

The core file includes the executable by reference using an absolute
path.  The executable was at /tmp/test, so that path is reproduced
here so the core dump reader can find the executable using this
testdata directory as the base directory.

core1.10 is produced in the same way, except using go1.10.0.
core1.11 is produced in the same way, except using go1.11.0.


steps for subsequent versions:

mkdir /tmp/coretest
cd /tmp/coretest
rm -fr *   // in case there's old junk there
cat the above program into test.go
go build test.go
ulimit -c unlimited
GOTRACEBACK=crash ./test
zip 1.12.zip /tmp/coretest/core /tmp/coretest/test  // use your version number

Then move the 1.12.zip to this directory.
Add a new test to TestVersions in ../gocore_test.go.

## runtimetype

This directory also contains the source code to generate the runtimetype core,
which is used to test getting runtime type for a interface.

steps for generate runtimetype core:

cd testdata/runtimetype
go build -o runtimetype .
ulimit -c unlimited
GOTRACEBACK=crash ./runtimetype
zip runtimetype.zip runtimetype core
